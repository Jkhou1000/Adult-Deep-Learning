# Deep Learning Prediction using Tensorflow and Keras

## Data 
This project uses [data provided by the UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult), a census on people and their income, specifically things like ones education, age, sex, if they earn over or under 50k. Using this data I trained a Deep Learning model to predict the income of a person with 14 attributes (not counting the target variable)

1. income  (The target) <=50k or >50k
2. age: continuous.
3. workclass: Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Self-emp-inc, Federal-gov, Local-gov, State-gov, Without-pay, Never-worked.
4. fnlwgt: continuous.
5. education: Bachelors, Some-college, 11th, HS-grad, Prof-school, Assoc-acdm, Assoc-voc, 9th, 7th-8th, 12th, Masters, 1st-4th, 10th, Doctorate, 5th-6th, Preschool.
6.education-num: continuous.
7. marital-status: Married-civ-spouse, Divorced, Never-married, Separated, Widowed, Married-spouse-absent, Married-AF-spouse.
8. occupation: Tech-support, Craft-repair, Other-service, Sales, Exec-managerial, Prof-specialty, Handlers-cleaners, Machine-op-inspct, Adm-clerical, Farming-fishing, Transport-moving, Priv-house-serv, Protective-serv, Armed-Forces.
9. relationship: Wife, Own-child, Husband, Not-in-family, Other-relative, Unmarried.
10. race: White, Asian-Pac-Islander, Amer-Indian-Eskimo, Other, Black.
11. sex: Female, Male.
12. capital-gain: continuous.
13. capital-loss: continuous.
14. hours-per-week: continuous.
15. native-country: United-States, Cambodia, England, Puerto-Rico, Canada, Germany, Outlying-US(Guam-USVI-etc), India, Japan, Greece, South, China, Cuba, Iran, Honduras, Philippines, Italy, Poland, Jamaica, Vietnam, Mexico, Portugal, Ireland, France, Dominican-Republic, Laos, Ecuador, Taiwan, Haiti, Columbia, Hungary, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Scotland, Thailand, Yugoslavia, El-Salvador, Trinadad&Tobago, Peru, Hong, Holand-Netherlands.
